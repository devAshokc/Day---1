1. What is the difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2
    
   Http is stands for Hypertext markup language and it is used to client server communication.
   By using HTTP user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.
   http1.1 v- which was standardized protocol more than 15 years on this field
   That was created in 1997 and the new one is http2 v- which was created in 2015

 Http1.1 v
   when you make a request to the server for the Someone.html page 
   And server responds to you as a resource Someone.html page before sending the request and the response there is a TCP connection established between client & server

 Http2 v
    HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. 
    HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format


2. Objects and its internal representation in Javascript
    
    In javascript, Object has collection of values and different datatype

For example :
      
     All cars have the same properties, but the property values differ from car to car. 

 var carFeatures;

     carFeatures ={
            Make: Mercedes,  Key: Value,
            Model: C-Class,  Key: Value,
            Color: White,    Key: Value,
            Fuel: Diesel,    Key: Value,
            Weight: 850kg,   Key: Value,
            Mileage: 8Kmpl,  Key: Value,
            Rating: 4.5      Key: Value
}

console.log(carFeatures[Rating])
